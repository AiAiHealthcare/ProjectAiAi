AiAi.care project aims to reduce Lung Cancer screening time by 90%, reduce screening cost by 90%, and improve survival probability by 5X through early detection.

AiAi team is building a CAD (Computer Aided Detection) algorithm that will scan Chest X-Rays using a Deep Learning models for Lung Cancer nodule detection and registration. AiAi.care will be world's first FDA approved, open-source CAD, and will be distributed for free to developing countries, charitable hospitals, and organizations like WHO.

# Contribute to Legal Strategy Wiki

Project AiAi is the first effort of its kind to donate an open-source, medical algorithm to the world.  This presents some interesting legal challenges, so we have [set up a wiki page where lawyers can donate their time and advice for Project AiAi.](https://github.com/AiAiHealthcare/ProjectAiAi/wiki)
