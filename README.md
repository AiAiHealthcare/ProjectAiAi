AiAi.care project is teaching computers to "see" chest X-rays and interpret them how a human Radiologist would. We are using 700,000 labeled Chest X-Rays + Deep Learning to build an FDA üíä approved, open-source screening tool for Tuberculosis and Lung Cancer. After an MRMC clinical trial, AiAi CAD will be distributed for free to emerging nations, charitable hospitals, and organizations like WHO üåè 

Our secondary goal is to open-source **'Medical Imagenet'** pretrained models and weights.  Medical data is hard to obtain, so many current Radiology-AI papers rely on transfer-learning ImageNet weights.  There are significant differences between ImageNet images (color, low-res, high-contrast) and Radiology images (grayscale, high-res, low-contrast), so we believe that our Medical Imagenet weights will improve sensitivity and specificity across the board for future research.

# Contribute to Legal Strategy Wiki

Project AiAi is the first effort of its kind to donate an open-source, medical algorithm to the world.  This presents some interesting legal challenges, so we have [set up a wiki page where lawyers can donate their time and advice for Project AiAi.](https://github.com/AiAiHealthcare/ProjectAiAi/wiki)
