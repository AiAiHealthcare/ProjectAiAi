AiAi is my code-charity project to create an open source Lung Cancer CAD (Computer-aided Detection) algorithm for the world. I plan to donate this radiology algorithm to Doctors without Borders and charitable hospitals in developing countries like India, Belarus, and Vietnam.

# Legal Strategy Wiki

Project AiAi is the first effort of its kind to donate an open-source, medical algorithm to the world.  This presents some interesting legal challenges, so we have [set up a wiki page where lawyers can donate their time and advice for Project AiAi.](https://github.com/AiAiHealthcare/ProjectAiAi/wiki)
